# Welcome :wave:

You are on Inspire Foundation's github organization profile.

We have created this org. to share the software developed in our research projects with a wider audience.

Check the progress of our Open-Source Initiative [here](https://github.com/orgs/InspireFoundationEc/projects/1).

## Resources for members
This is a collection of useful resources & guidelines for our first steps as an organization into the world of open-source.

### Git & Github

If it's your first time working with git and/or github, take a moment and go over [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/blob/main/1-getting-started-lessons/2-github-basics/README.md). 

Once you've created your github account, [send me and email](mailto:linomp95@hotmail.com?subject=[Inspire%20Foundation]%20New%20Github%20Org%20Member) to add you to the org, and you will be ready for contributing here!

### Creating good repositories

- Every repo should have a README with the following sections: 
  - **Installation** - dependencies with specific versions (show the commands to just copy & paste)
  - **Get started** - 1 or 2 examples that users can literally just copy, paste and run
  - **Learn more** - where to go for more info; link to more extensive documentation

- Repos to take inspiration from:
  - https://github.com/motiwari/BanditPAM
  - https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy
  - https://github.com/AutomatedProcessImprovement/knockouts-redesign
